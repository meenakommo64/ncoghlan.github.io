About Curious Efficiency
========================

About the site
--------------

Curious Efficiency is the intermittently updated personal website of Nicholas
Coghlan, CPython core developer, PSF Director, Red Hat toolsmith, cognitive
science dabbler, and cynical idealist.

The main portion of the site is generated via
`Nikola <http://getnikola.com/>`__,
hosted on `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__,
and under source control on
`BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/curiousefficiency/>`__.

Python specific technical writing tends to end up on the
`ReadTheDocs <http://readthedocs.org/>`__ powered
`Python Notes <http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org>`__ subsite.


About the name
--------------

Curious Efficiency is actually a reframing of my original blog title,
Boredom & Laziness - the original boredomandlaziness.org URLs now redirect
here. The original site blurb on Boredom & Laziness read as follows:

   There are a couple of very, very scary things in this world.

   The first is a bored human. Bored humans have time to indulge their
   curiosity, with potentially amazing results.

   The second is a lazy human. Lazy humans can be quite inventive when it
   comes to figuring out how to do less work.

   So, here's to boredom & laziness - two of the prime movers in human progress!

"Curious Efficiency" is really just a nicer way of referring to the same
concept.

`This post <../posts/2012/07/the-title-of-this-blog.html>`__ goes into some
additional detail on the concepts that inspired the naming, both the original
form, and the current more conventionally acceptable phrasing.


About the author

Nick is a CPython core developer and a member of the Board of Directors
for the Python Software Foundation. He is the author or co-author of several
accepted Python Enhancement Proposals (including PEP 343, which added the
with statement and context managers in Python 2.5, and PEP 453 which saw
the ``pip`` installer bundled with Python 3.4), and has also accepted
a number of PEPs on Guido van Rossum's behalf as BDFL-Delegate.

Nick is currently the BDFL-Delegate for most packaging related PEPs, serving
as the primary liaison between the CPython core development team and the
Python Packaging Authority. His own efforts in the packaging space are
focused primarily on the metadata 2.0 interoperability standards (PEP 426,
440, 459) and on communicating the ongoing work of the Python Packaging
Authority to the broader Python community.

At the PyCon US 2013 language summit, Nick successfully argued for updates to
the Python Enhancement Proposal process (described in PEP 1) that allowed
BDFL-Delegates to approve PEPs that don't affect the language definition or
the standard library directly on the relevant mailing lists (without needing
to rehash the discussions on python-dev).

Since June 2011, after more than 12 years in the aerospace and defence
sector with Boeing Australia, Nick has been working on development and test
infrastructure for Red Hat. He is currently the Provisioning Architect for
several of the automated test systems, a role which covers both ensuring that
the test systems can test the products Red Hat supports, as well as adopting
those same products to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the test
infrastructure. Current projects of particular interest include:

* `Beaker <https://beaker-project.org>`__: Red Hat's custom full stack
  software integration and testing system that allows fine-grained selection
  of hardware, and testing with unreleased versions of Fedora, Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux and CentOS
* `Project Atomic <http://www.projectatomic.io/>`__: an integration project
  bringing Docker containers together with several existing components of the
  Red Hat ecosystem
* `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__: the general purpose scale out
  cloud infrastructure originally published by RackSpace, and now the centre
  of a fast growing ecosystem of public and private cloud providers
* `OpenShift <https://www.openstack.org/>`__: Red Hat's fully open source
  Platform-as-a-Service offering
* `Software Collections <https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/>`__: an
  approach to deploying platform components (such as language runtimes,
  databases engines and web servers) on Linux, such that end user
  applications can use newer versions without interfering with the versions
  integrated directly into the underlying operating system distribution
