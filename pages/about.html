<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>Curious Efficiency is the intermittently updated personal website of Nicholas
Coghlan, CPython core developer, PSF Director, Red Hat toolsmith, cognitive
science dabbler, and cynical idealist.</p>
<p>The main portion of the site is generated via
<a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>,
hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>,
and under source control on
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/curiousefficiency/">BitBucket</a>.</p>
<p>Python specific technical writing tends to end up on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDocs</a> powered
<a class="reference external" href="http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org">Python Notes</a> subsite.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-name">
<h2>About the name</h2>
<p>Curious Efficiency is actually a reframing of my original blog title,
Boredom &amp; Laziness - the original boredomandlaziness.org URLs now redirect
here. The original site blurb on Boredom &amp; Laziness read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of very, very scary things in this world.</p>
<p>The first is a bored human. Bored humans have time to indulge their
curiosity, with potentially amazing results.</p>
<p>The second is a lazy human. Lazy humans can be quite inventive when it
comes to figuring out how to do less work.</p>
<p>So, here's to boredom &amp; laziness - two of the prime movers in human progress!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Curious Efficiency" is really just a nicer way of referring to the same
concept.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/07/the-title-of-this-blog.html">This post</a> goes into some
additional detail on the concepts that inspired the naming, both the original
form, and the current more conventionally acceptable phrasing.</p>

<h2>About the author</h2>
<img alt="../files/pycon2011_language_summit_cropped.jpg" class="align-right" src="../files/pycon2011_language_summit_cropped.jpg">
<p>Nick is a CPython core developer and a member of the Board of Directors
for the Python Software Foundation. He is the author or co-author of several
accepted Python Enhancement Proposals (including PEP 343, which added the
with statement and context managers in Python 2.5, and PEP 453 which saw
the <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> installer bundled with Python 3.4), and has also accepted
a number of PEPs on Guido van Rossum's behalf as BDFL-Delegate.</p>
<p>Nick is currently the BDFL-Delegate for most packaging related PEPs, serving
as the primary liaison between the CPython core development team and the
Python Packaging Authority. His own efforts in the packaging space are
focused primarily on the metadata 2.0 interoperability standards (PEP 426,
440, 459) and on communicating the ongoing work of the Python Packaging
Authority to the broader Python community.</p>
<p>At the PyCon US 2013 language summit, Nick successfully argued for updates to
the Python Enhancement Proposal process (described in PEP 1) that allowed
BDFL-Delegates to approve PEPs that don't affect the language definition or
the standard library directly on the relevant mailing lists (without needing
to rehash the discussions on python-dev).</p>
<p>Since June 2011, after more than 12 years in the aerospace and defence
sector with Boeing Australia, Nick has been working on development and test
infrastructure for Red Hat.</p>
<p>He is currently a software development workflow designer &amp; process architect
for several of Red Hat's internal services, focusing on the use of the
upstream
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle">Atomic Developer Bundle</a>
project as a venue for collaboration on Vagrant and Docker based process
improvement efforts related to sustainable maintenance of web service
projects spanning a variety of programming languages, including Python,
Perl, Ruby, Node.js, PHP and Java.</p>
<p>In addition to CPython, the PSF, and the Atomic Developer Bundle, other
projects &amp; programs of particular current interest include:</p>
