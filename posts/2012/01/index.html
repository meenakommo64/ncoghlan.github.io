    <a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/">WalkDir</a> is my Python support library that aims to make it as easy to work with filtered directory listings as it is to walk over entire directory trees with os.walk().<br><br>The module's design tries to take full advantage of Python's iterator model - most of its functionality is provided by pipelined iterators that accept os.walk() style iterables and expose the same interface themselves. <br><br>The only major functional change in version 0.3 is that these pipelined iterators now make sure they pass along the objects produced by the underlying iterators, and only use indexing operations to access the individual fields. Previously they would use tuple unpacking to access the directory details, which restricted the supported types to those with exactly 3 fields and also had the side effect of replacing the underlying objects with ordinary 3-tuples.<br><br>I changed this mainly due to a new OS interface that is likely to be coming in Python 3.3: an <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue13734">os.walk() variant</a> that produces a 4-tuple rather than a 3-tuple. The 4th value will be a file descriptor for the directory making it easier (in conjunction with new <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.3.html#os">file descriptor based APIs</a> in the 3.3 os module) to write filesystem modification code that is robust against <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue4489">symlink attacks</a>. By passing the underlying objects through unmodified, WalkDir is now compatible with this API - all the path based filtering will still work, but the file descriptor values will also be passed along correctly.<br><br>For those that haven't seen any of my previous comments on WalkDir, the other parts of the API are just there for convenience - one factory  function that constructs pipelines for you, and 3 terminal iterators  that flatten out the os.walk() style triples into a simple series of  paths (all paths, just the visited directories or just the file paths).<br><br>The other notable change in 0.3 is the list of officially supported versions. Previously, the module was only known to work on 2.7 and 3.2+ (since they're the versions I have on my home development machine). However, thanks to a free open source account provided by the folks at <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/job/WalkDir/">Shining Panda</a>, WalkDir 0.3 is known to work on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1+ (I even test it on PyPy and Stackless, just because I can). After pushing a broken package to PyPI for 0.2, I even have a <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/job/WalkDirInstaller/">sanity check</a> I can run that ensures the module can be downloaded with pip and then imported on all the supported versions.<br><br>

    <p>I  figure this is the easiest place to publish the message I just sent to  Larissa Waters, the Greens Senator that is one of Queensland's  representatives in the Federal Senate. I also wrote to Yvette D'ath (our  local MHR) a few days ago, but I didn't keep a copy of that one. Will  this achieve anything? Probably not, but hey, at least I tried (and if  none of their constituents ever write to them about it, our reps are  quite entitled to assume we're all OK with them selling out the county  to legacy US media interests): <br></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Senator Waters,<br><br>With  today being the day Wikipedia and a wide range of other sites have  either gone dark or taken other action to protest draconian internet  censorship legislation making its way through the US Congress, it seems  an opportune time to highlight our own government's ongoing concerning  behaviour on that front.<br><br>Of particular concern is their <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2012/01/17/govt-censors-secret-anti-piracy-meeting-notes/">continuing refusal</a> to release details of a secretive meeting between government  representatives and representatives of the same organisations that are  behind the draconian US bills currently being protested. The government  even <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/12/23/secret-piracy-talks-govt-banned-consumer-groups/">deliberately excluded</a> representatives of a number of community interest organisations that sought to attend these discussions.<br><br>These  legacy media companies (aka horse drawn carriage manufacturers) are  flailing around wildly as the rise of free and open digital  communications networks (aka automobiles) threatens the cherished  gatekeeper role they have enjoyed for the past few decades as media  distributors. They have failed to adapt, and are increasingly being  bypassed as artists, writers, musicians, comedians and other media  creators find ways to use the power of the internet to connect more  directly with their fans. These direct connections are great for both  artists and fans, but place the intermediaries like YouTube, Apple  iTunes, Amazon, BandCamp, Flickr, etc, in the role of service providers  to the artists and fans rather than gatekeepers to widespread  distribution. Unfortunately, instead of going gracefully into that good  night, these organisations are investing inordinate sums of money  worldwide in lobbying for legislation that would make the permissive,  open practices of most of these new service providers a recipe for  prohibitively high legal liabilities, effectively making those practices  unsustainable and thus breaking the internet as we know it today.<br><br>Australia  already markedly shifted many intellectual monopoly policies to favour  the interests of US copyright holders at the expense of Australian  citizens when we signed the US-FTA some time ago. We have also  participated in the secretive process of drafting the  Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which spends far more time  considering digital copyright infringement than it does actual  counterfeiting. The current negotiations over membership in the  Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement raise legitimate fears that  Australia's intellectual monopoly policy will be shifted even further  towards the draconian position of the United State Trade Representative,  even as those policies are being protested strongly within the US  itself.<br><br>In line with your <a href="http://greens.org.au/policies/human-rights-democracy/community-participation-in-government">published policy</a> on community participation in government, do the Greens plan to  publicly question the government over their apparent willingness to  place the interest of large US companies ahead of those of individual  Australian citizens?<br><br>Regards,<br>Nick.</i></blockquote>
