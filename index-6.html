        <p>Years ago (but still within the last decade) I was involved in a source control trade study for a large multi-national corporation. Management had let a non-software developer select the original "source control tool" and they had picked something that required custom scripting just to do a baseline (I wish I was kidding).<br><br>So a bunch of candidate replacements were put forward for consideration, and CVS won because it was free, thus there would be fewer arguments with management about rolling it out on a project that was already over budget and behind schedule. (The fact that Subversion wasn't considered as a candidate should give you some additional hints about the precise timing of this - Subversion 1.0 was released in February 2004. Yes, for those that are new to this game, you read that right: it is only within the last decade that the majority of the open source VCS world began to enjoy the benefits of atomic commits).<br><br>Other interesting aspects of that system included the fact that one of the developers on that project basically had to write a custom xUnit testing system from scratch in order to start putting together a decent automated test suite for the system, there was no code review tool, and you couldn't include direct links to bug tracker items in emails or anything else - you had to reference them by name or number, and people would then look those names or numbers up in the dedicated bug tracking application client.<br><br>High level design documentation, if it existed at all, was in the form of Microsoft Word documents. Low level API documentation? Yes, that would have been nice (there were some attempts to generate something vaguely readable with Doxygen but, yeah, well, C++).<br><br>Less than ten years later, though, and there are signs our industry is starting to grow up (although I expect many enterprise shops are still paying extortionate rates to the likes of IBM for the "Rational" suite of tools only to gain a significantly inferior development experience):<br></p><ol><li>You can get genuinely high quality code hosting for free. Sure <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> was already around back then, but Git and Mercurial stomp all over CVS from a collaboration point of view. These also come with decent issue trackers and various other collaboration tools. If you don't want to trust a service provider with your code, than tools like <a href="http://gitlabhq.com/">GitLab</a> let you set up similar environments internally.</li><li>Web based issue trackers are everywhere, with the ubiquitous "issue URL" allowing effective cross-linking between tracker issues, documentation, code comments, source control browsers, code review systems, etc.</li><li>Dedicated code review tools like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rietveld/">Reitveld</a> are published as open source (and, in the case of the latter, even available as a free service on <a href="http://codereview.appspot.com/">Google App Engine</a>).</li><li>Services like <a href="http://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDocs</a> exist, allowing you to easily build and publish high quality documentation. All with nice URLs so you can link it from emails, tracker issues, source code, etc.</li><li>Organisations like <a href="https://www.shiningpanda.com/">Shining Panda CI</a> and <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> provide hosted continuous integration services that put the internal capabilities of many large companies to shame.</li><li>Language communities provide cross-platform distribution services to reach a global audience.</li><li>Depending on the language you use, you may even have tools like <a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">SonarSource</a> available</li><li>Once you go into production in the web application world, service components like <a href="https://www.getsentry.com/welcome/">Sentry</a>, <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, and <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/faq">Graphite</a> are again available for no charge.</li></ol>And to access all this good stuff for free? All you have to do is be willing to share your work (and sometimes not even that). If you don't want to share your work, then the service providers generally have very reasonable fees - you could probably put together a state of the art suite of tools for less than a few hundred bucks a month.<br><br>Take my own hobby projects as an example:<br><ul><li>they're hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/">BitBucket</a> as Mercurial projects (I happen to prefer Mercurial, although I can definitely see why people like Git, too). That gives me integrated issue tracking and online source code browsing, too. (OK, so I could have had essentially that back in the early SourceForge days, but the UI aspects have improved in many respects in the intervening years)</li><li>I can publish my projects on the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/">Python Package Index</a> with a simple "<span>setup.py sdist upload</span>". They're then available for anyone in the world to install with a straightforward command like "<span>pip install walkdir</span>"</li><li>thanks to <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/">Shining Panda CI</a>, I know the downloads from PyPI work, and I also know that the projects work on all the versions and implementations of Python I want to support</li><li>thanks to <a href="http://readthedocs.org/profiles/ncoghlan/">ReadTheDocs</a> and <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>, you can read nicely formatted documentation like <a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/">this</a> rather than trying to decipher plain text files or wiki pages.</li></ul>I'm living in the future and it is seriously <i>cool</i> (and that's just looking at things purely from a software development infrastructure point of view - the rise of "Infrastructure as a Service" and "Platform as a Service" providers, including Red Hat's own <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/">OpenShift</a>, has massive implications on the deployment side of things, and there's of course the implications of the many open source wheels that don't need to be reinvented)<br><br>The best part from my point of view is that these days I get to work for a <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">company</a> that already genuinely understands the long term significance of the power of collaborative development. It also doesn't hurt that there's still a lot of money to be made in helping the rest of the enterprise world come to grips with that reality :)

        <p>Inspired by Michael Foord's efforts with <span>unittest2</span>, <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/">contextlib2</a> is a PyPI package where I am working on some new additions to the standard library's <span>contextlib</span> module for Python 3.3.<br><br>The most interesting of those is a replacement for the ill-fated <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/contextlib#contextlib.nested">contextlib.nested</a> API.<br><br>If you use Python 3.2 today, you'll find that the <span>contextlib.nested</span> API doesn't even exist any more. The reason it was deprecated and removed is because it didn't play well with context managers that acquired their resources in <span>__init__</span> rather than <span>__enter__</span> (such as Python's own file objects and many other resources where using a with statement for management is an optional convenience rather than being mandatory).<br><br>The simplest example where the old API caused problems was opening a list of files and then using <span>contextlib.nested</span> to close them all when the operation was complete - if opening any later file threw an exception (e.g. due to a permissions error or a bad file name), then all of the earlier files would remain open until the garbage collector got around to cleaning them up. Not a huge problem on CPython with its refcounting based GC, but a far cry from the deterministic resource cleanup that context managers are supposed to offer.<br><br>Since the deprecation and removal of <span>contextlib.nested</span>, there have been assorted replacement proposals of varying levels of sophistication posted to the Python ideas mailing list. The new <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#contextlib2.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> API in this release is my own latest effort, and the first that I've liked well enough to seriously consider as a candidate for inclusion in the standard library module.<br><br>The idea behind providing the <span>ExitStack</span> API is for the standard library to focus specifically on handling the one particularly tricky part of dealing with context managers programmatically: unwinding the context stack correctly, ensuring that exceptions are processed exactly as if any context managers involved had been used in an appropriate series of nested with statements.<br><br>A couple of convenience methods are included (one that enters a context manager in addition to pushing the exit method on to the stack, as well as a simple callback registration method inspired by <span>unittest.TestCase.addCleanup</span>), but the features of the API are otherwise fairly minimal.<br><br>This low level dynamic API can then be used by developers to create their own higher level convenience APIs, as suggested in some of the <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#replacing-any-use-of-try-finally-and-flag-variables">examples</a> in the documentation.<br><br>A few specific design notes:<br></p><ul><li>The name <span>ExitStack</span> came about because the object is literally a stack of exit method references (or callback wrappers that behave like exit methods). Earlier variants were <span>ContextStack</span> (too narrow, since you can use the stack for standalone callbacks) and <span>CallbackStack</span> (too broad, since the stored callbacks specifically have the signature of exit methods)</li><li>The <span>push()</span> method accepts exit methods directly, since those are what actually gets stored on the stack. Ducktyping to also accept objects with an <span>__exit__()</span> method is convenient without being confusing (I hope).</li><li>The <span>enter_context()</span> method uses the longer name because the shorter version is too easy to confuse with the stack's own <span>__enter__()</span> method.</li></ul>If you have any questions about the <span>ExitStack</span> design, this is the place to ask. If you find any bugs or other defects, head over to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/contextlib2/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">issue tracker</a>.<br>

        <a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/">WalkDir</a> is my Python support library that aims to make it as easy to work with filtered directory listings as it is to walk over entire directory trees with os.walk().<br><br>The module's design tries to take full advantage of Python's iterator model - most of its functionality is provided by pipelined iterators that accept os.walk() style iterables and expose the same interface themselves. <br><br>The only major functional change in version 0.3 is that these pipelined iterators now make sure they pass along the objects produced by the underlying iterators, and only use indexing operations to access the individual fields. Previously they would use tuple unpacking to access the directory details, which restricted the supported types to those with exactly 3 fields and also had the side effect of replacing the underlying objects with ordinary 3-tuples.<br><br>I changed this mainly due to a new OS interface that is likely to be coming in Python 3.3: an <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue13734">os.walk() variant</a> that produces a 4-tuple rather than a 3-tuple. The 4th value will be a file descriptor for the directory making it easier (in conjunction with new <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.3.html#os">file descriptor based APIs</a> in the 3.3 os module) to write filesystem modification code that is robust against <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue4489">symlink attacks</a>. By passing the underlying objects through unmodified, WalkDir is now compatible with this API - all the path based filtering will still work, but the file descriptor values will also be passed along correctly.<br><br>For those that haven't seen any of my previous comments on WalkDir, the other parts of the API are just there for convenience - one factory  function that constructs pipelines for you, and 3 terminal iterators  that flatten out the os.walk() style triples into a simple series of  paths (all paths, just the visited directories or just the file paths).<br><br>The other notable change in 0.3 is the list of officially supported versions. Previously, the module was only known to work on 2.7 and 3.2+ (since they're the versions I have on my home development machine). However, thanks to a free open source account provided by the folks at <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/job/WalkDir/">Shining Panda</a>, WalkDir 0.3 is known to work on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1+ (I even test it on PyPy and Stackless, just because I can). After pushing a broken package to PyPI for 0.2, I even have a <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/job/WalkDirInstaller/">sanity check</a> I can run that ensures the module can be downloaded with pip and then imported on all the supported versions.<br><br>

        <p>I  figure this is the easiest place to publish the message I just sent to  Larissa Waters, the Greens Senator that is one of Queensland's  representatives in the Federal Senate. I also wrote to Yvette D'ath (our  local MHR) a few days ago, but I didn't keep a copy of that one. Will  this achieve anything? Probably not, but hey, at least I tried (and if  none of their constituents ever write to them about it, our reps are  quite entitled to assume we're all OK with them selling out the county  to legacy US media interests): <br></p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Senator Waters,<br><br>With  today being the day Wikipedia and a wide range of other sites have  either gone dark or taken other action to protest draconian internet  censorship legislation making its way through the US Congress, it seems  an opportune time to highlight our own government's ongoing concerning  behaviour on that front.<br><br>Of particular concern is their <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2012/01/17/govt-censors-secret-anti-piracy-meeting-notes/">continuing refusal</a> to release details of a secretive meeting between government  representatives and representatives of the same organisations that are  behind the draconian US bills currently being protested. The government  even <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/12/23/secret-piracy-talks-govt-banned-consumer-groups/">deliberately excluded</a> representatives of a number of community interest organisations that sought to attend these discussions.<br><br>These  legacy media companies (aka horse drawn carriage manufacturers) are  flailing around wildly as the rise of free and open digital  communications networks (aka automobiles) threatens the cherished  gatekeeper role they have enjoyed for the past few decades as media  distributors. They have failed to adapt, and are increasingly being  bypassed as artists, writers, musicians, comedians and other media  creators find ways to use the power of the internet to connect more  directly with their fans. These direct connections are great for both  artists and fans, but place the intermediaries like YouTube, Apple  iTunes, Amazon, BandCamp, Flickr, etc, in the role of service providers  to the artists and fans rather than gatekeepers to widespread  distribution. Unfortunately, instead of going gracefully into that good  night, these organisations are investing inordinate sums of money  worldwide in lobbying for legislation that would make the permissive,  open practices of most of these new service providers a recipe for  prohibitively high legal liabilities, effectively making those practices  unsustainable and thus breaking the internet as we know it today.<br><br>Australia  already markedly shifted many intellectual monopoly policies to favour  the interests of US copyright holders at the expense of Australian  citizens when we signed the US-FTA some time ago. We have also  participated in the secretive process of drafting the  Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which spends far more time  considering digital copyright infringement than it does actual  counterfeiting. The current negotiations over membership in the  Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement raise legitimate fears that  Australia's intellectual monopoly policy will be shifted even further  towards the draconian position of the United State Trade Representative,  even as those policies are being protested strongly within the US  itself.<br><br>In line with your <a href="http://greens.org.au/policies/human-rights-democracy/community-participation-in-government">published policy</a> on community participation in government, do the Greens plan to  publicly question the government over their apparent willingness to  place the interest of large US companies ahead of those of individual  Australian citizens?<br><br>Regards,<br>Nick.</i></blockquote><br>

        <div class="entry-body"><div><div class="item-body"><div>I'm normally a curmudgeon about this kind of thing, but I enjoyed reading some of the other posts in this series <a href="http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/new-years-python-meme-2/" target="_blank">Tarek</a> kicked off, so I decided to make my own contribution.<br><br><b>1. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2011?</b> <br>The move to Red Hat marked my entry into the world of web development (previously I'd merely been in interested observer of that world, rather than a participant). By far my favourite discovery since making that change is <a href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">django-rest-framework</a> - with that, I can use my web browser to browse early iterations of my server's REST API directly, without needing to write custom clients to process the JSON data from APIs that are still in a state of flux.<br><br>As a service, <a href="http://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDocs</a> has been an absolute revelation - between that, code hosting &amp; issue management sites like BitBucket and GitHub and of course PyPI itself, it's now possible for an open source project to have a quite respectable web presence without the developers needing to understand anything more than Sphinx, source control and the project they're working on.<br><br><b>2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2011?</b> <br>REST would be the big one. I'd had some general exposure to the concept in the past, but there's no substitute for sitting down and building it into a product when it comes to understanding a programming or API design technique.<br><br><b>3. What's the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2011? What did you do?</b> <br>CPython, by far - kibbitzing on python-dev and python-ideas (and import-sig too these days), writing and reviewing several different PEPs, documentation updates, code reviews and patch applications, as well as working on my own things (including the still-in-progress integration work for the 'yield from' expression that's coming in 3.3).<br><br>I also recently started up 4 separate open source projects - 3 PyPI modules to hopefully address deficiencies I see in the current standard library offerings, plus the upstream open source project for my current development efforts at Red Hat:<br><ul><li><a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/">contextlib2</a> (ContextStack has some potential as a new building block)</li><li><a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/">WalkDir</a> (the idea here is to be the "itertools for os.walk()")</li><li><a href="http://shell-command.readthedocs.org/">Shell Command</a> (let Python handle control flow, the shell actual commands)</li><li><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/pulpdist/">PulpDist</a> (Bringing a semblance of order to small-scale rsync mirror networks)</li></ul><br><b>4. What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011?</b>  <br><a href="http://planet.python.org/" target="_blank">Planet Python</a>.<br><br><b>5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012?</b> <br>From a work point of view, getting my RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) is at the top of the list. Coming up to speed on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a close second. Finally, I want to fill in more of the gaps in my very sketchy knowledge of web UI development (i.e. HTML/CSS/Javascript).<br><br><b>6. What are the top software, app or lib you wish someone would write in 2012?</b> <br>I want to see the <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/ncoghlan_devs-python-notes/en/latest/pep_ideas/preview_namespace.html">__preview__ namespace</a> (in particular, the regex module) make it into Python 3.3. But that requires a volunteer to step up and write the PEP, write the code and generally champion the idea (if we have to wait for me to do it, there's no way it will happen before 3.4).<br><br>Want to do your own list? here's how: <br><ol><li>copy-paste the questions and answer to them in your blog</li><li>tweet it with the <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/search/%232012pythonmeme" target="_blank">#2012pythonmeme</a> hashtag</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

        <p>... and hopefully help yourself with current programming projects, too.<br><br>Some recent programming activities left me underwhelmed by a few of the standard library's included batteries. This has already led to a significant revamp of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess">subprocess module documentation</a> to steer new users away from the Popen Swiss army knife (unless they really need it) and to explain the commonly needed parameters more clearly. It still needs work (the notes and warnings are far too repetitive), but it at least introduces things in the right order now (high level convenience API that most people want first, lower level Popen API that some people need second).<br><br>However, for 3.3 I'd like to improve things even more in at least three areas: invocation of the system shell for administration tasks, better tools for traversing filesystem directories and programmatic management of deterministic resource cleanup (i.e. not relying on the garbage collector).<br><br>Accordingly, I have 3 projects up on PyPI (with docs on ReadTheDocs and source control and issue tracking on BitBucket):<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/">WalkDir</a>: os.walk() style iterators with file and directory filtering (both inclusion and exclusion), depth limiting and symlink loop detection, as well as convenience iterators to flatten os.walk() style iterators into a series of paths (either all walked paths, just the directories or just the files). I currently plan to make (at least some of) these part of the shutil module, but exactly <i>what</i> gets added will be based on the feedback I receive on this module and its API design.</li><li><a href="http://shell-command.readthedocs.org/">Shell Command</a>: Convenience APIs that combine subprocess invocation with string interpolation. Interpolated strings are escaped with shlex.quote() by default, with a custom conversion specifier ("!u", for unquoted) used to invoke the standard interpolation process. It also features an experimental API where I'm tinkering with the use of select.select() on subprocess pipes (I'm not sure it achieves a lot over simple blocking IO in its current form, though). The current plan for this API is that it will be added directly to the subprocess module (well, the stable and sensible parts will be, anyway - I still have my doubts about the select.select() experiment)</li><li><a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/">contextlib2</a>: This module basically exists to let me publish and gather feedback on ContextStack, a proposed addition to contextlib for 3.3 that should make it easier to manage deterministic resource cleanup programmatically (i.e. without coupling it as directly to code layout as simple with statements do).</li></ul><br>Feedback on any and all of these is appreciated, either here or on the respective issue trackers. It isn't a foregone conclusion that any of these APIs will be added at all, so examples of real world use cases would definitely be helpful.
