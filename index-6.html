        <p>OK, so here's the thing. In the real world, most Australians talking about 'Nick Coghlan' are going to be talking about the guy on Secret Life of Us. If not him, then the surfer from somewhere down south. If we went to Canada, well, there's a diplomat by that name, so at least a few people would know who he is, or would have seen an article or two about him.<br><br>Enter the world of Google, though, and an awful lot of it is about me. On the first two pages of a search for "Nick Coghlan", there's just one entry halfway down the second page for the Canadian guy. The other two don't show up until the third page. The results are skewed massively in my favour because of the public mailing list web archives that Google indexes - and every one of my messages to those lists includes my name.<br><br>You can really see the effect of this by searching for "Nicholas Coghlan" instead. I disappear from the results, and the TV actor and the Canadian diplomat take control of the show. I don't show up until page 4, on an old announcement from UQ. As you might guess from that, I don't use my full first name very often.<br><br>Another interesting search is "nick coghlan -python -cygwin -software". The results are then quite similar to the "nicholas coghlan" results.<br><br>Anyway, I guess my only real observation is that, when searching just for names, Google gives extremely high weight to participation in public online communities. Obvious, one might say, but it's an interesting limitation when looking for information on more famous people that happen to share a name with someone like me.</p>

        <p>Suppose a new employee came to work for you. They're asked to collect 20 items from the company warehouse. You come back at the end of the day to find they have retrieved only one of the items. When queried, they say, "Well, the warheouse didn't have the second item on the list, so I came back to see what you wanted to do about it." "OK, fine, where are the other 18 items, then?" "Oh, I didn't try to get those. I needed to ask you about the second item, so I came back here." You'd be justifiably pissed off, and they'd probably be well on their way to getting fired.<br><br>Yast Online Update is that employee. If it encounters a problem with any of the packages you ask it to install, it sits there with a freaking dialog box on the screen doing absolutely <b>nothing</b> until you come back and tell it, "Look, just get on with the rest of the downloads already".<br><br>To be fair, this problem isn't specific to YOU - YOU just happens to be the most recent example I've encountered. When a computer program is given a list of tasks to do, and encounters a problem with one of them, it should look at the list and continue on with as many of the remaining tasks as it can. At the end, it can present a report detailing any problems encountered, and asking what is to be done about each of them. With Brain Dead Software like YOU, I can't just leave it to run overnight - chances are it will only do useful work for a short while before some glitch causes it to twiddle its thumbs for the rest of the night, waiting for me to wake up and reassure it that everything is fine.<br><br>Anyway, that's Brain Dead Software - programs that do things that would get a human fired. I'm sure there'll be more entries in this category.</p>

        <p>When I was in the US, one of the most impressive things I saw was the area around Mt St Helens. It was one of those things that made me glad my digital camera makes it so easy to take panoramic shots (click the panoramics to see slightly larger versions. If you want actual prints of any photos I post, let me know, since the originals have much better resolution than the versions I post).<br><br>The river valley downstream from the mountain:<br><a href="http://boredomandlaziness.skystorm.net/images/123-376_381_ST.jpg" target="_top"><img alt="" border="0" height="63" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ncoghlan/boredomandlaziness/images/123-376_381_ST.jpg" width="357"></a><br><br>The view from the interpretative centre:<br><a href="http://boredomandlaziness.skystorm.net/images/123-384_389_ST.jpg" target="_top"><img alt="" border="0" height="61" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ncoghlan/boredomandlaziness/images/123-384_389_ST.jpg" width="361"></a><br><br>Heading around the back of the ridge:<br><a href="http://boredomandlaziness.skystorm.net/images/123-392_398_ST.jpg" target="_top"><img alt="" border="0" height="49" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ncoghlan/boredomandlaziness/images/123-392_398_ST.jpg" width="387"></a><br><br>Looking back towards the next ridge:<br><a href="http://boredomandlaziness.skystorm.net/images/124-401_408_ST.jpg" target="_top"><img alt="" border="0" height="61" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ncoghlan/boredomandlaziness/images/124-401_408_ST.jpg" width="429"></a><br><br>And here we have Leung making an appearance (Leung is the mascot I took with me on my trip. He's a little big to make a great photo mascot, so there are long stretches of photos where he doesn't appear). Anyway, the real point of this photo is the effect of the lateral blast from the eruption. Most of the grey stuff on the ridgeline is actually dead trees that were knocked over by the blast. You can see a bunch of trunks still standing where they were sheltered by the ridgeline.<br><a href="http://boredomandlaziness.skystorm.net/images/124-414_IMG.jpg" target="_top"><img alt="" border="0" height="300" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ncoghlan/boredomandlaziness/images/124-414_IMG.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

        <p>Python's a very nice language to program in, but it does have a few quirks. Normally, if you put multiple strings in your code, Python will automatically combine them into a single string.<br><br>However, it *doesn't* do this if your string literals are positioned in the "docstring" location for a class or function. If they are then only the first string will be used as the docstring - the remainder will be ignored.<br><br><b>Update:</b> A quick discussion on python-dev showed that the behaviour was fairly easily explained. The string literal concatenation magic only works inside a single expression (e.g. an assignment statement). Two string literals on separate lines look like two distinct statements to the interpreter. Escaping the newline after the first literal causes the string concatenation behaviour to be applied.</p>

        <p>So, I occasionally post stuff over at <a href="http://www.talkinboutstuff.net" target="_top">Talkinboutstuff</a>. However, that's mostly for random crap I expect the rest of the guys to find interesting/annoying/whatever.
<br>
<br>So, I created this extra blog for myself - somewhere to pontificate about things I <i>don't</i> expect them to find interesting, like software and Python and open source and what have you. And, anything of interest to them can be cross-linked quite happily :)
<br>
<br>Maybe I'll even get around to attaching this thing to a real domain name!</p>
