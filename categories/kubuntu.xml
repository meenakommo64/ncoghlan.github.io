much of our economic activity is devoted to preventing boredom in the idle
time created by increases in efficiency. To be human is to be a strange
creature indeed :)

(Why, I have no idea. The latter is the first partition and the one that holds the MBR, so os-prober is clearly going to some effort to find and enforce the wrong partition).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After searching on Google and with a bit of experimentation, I was able to fix it by booting off a LiveCD, adding the line "GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true" to "/etc/default/grub" and then running "sudo update-grub".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><guid>http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/201106fixing-grub2-update-issues-with-kubuntu.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 12:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
