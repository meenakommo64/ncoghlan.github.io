I'm very jealous of my idle time - I &lt;i&gt;don't like it&lt;/i&gt; when I have things planned in advance night after night, week after week. I want my downtime to just do whatever seems interesting at the time, and I don't function well if I find it necessary to go without it for an extended period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being bored and being lazy are widely seen as things to be avoided. However, it all depends on how you look at them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boredom is largely a sign of incredible &lt;i&gt;luxury&lt;/i&gt; - a time when the world is placing no immediate demands on us, so we have to come up with some means of satisfying our innate desire to be &lt;i&gt;doing something&lt;/i&gt;. Being bored means we're not busy obtaining food, or water, or shelter, or defending ourselves (or our food/water/shelter) from attackers, or otherwise pursuing the basic necessities of survival. It's an opportunity to play - maybe to explore (and change!) the world around us, maybe to explore fictional worlds created by others, maybe to create fictional worlds of our own, or to teach others about the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The negative view on being lazy often rests on unstated assumptions (even fears) about the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of life: "Make more of yourself!", "Do something with your life!", "Leave your mark on the world!". When you get right down to it though, nobody (and I mean nobody) knows the meaning of life. We don't really know why it's better to get out of bed each morning and face the world - we just choose to believe that life is better than non-life, and engaging with the world is better than ignoring it. We create all sorts of stories we tell ourselves to justify our reasons for rejecting nihilism (to the point of killing each other over our choice of stories), but it ultimately comes down to a decision that the only life we know we have is this one, so we may as well do what can to try and enjoy it while we're here. Once we make that decision, and our basic survival needs are taken care of, everything beyond that point is optional and what we pursue will depend on what we're taught to perceive as valuable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look at the developed world, massive sections of it are aimed at giving people something to do when they're bored because their basic survival needs are taken care of more efficiently than they are by subsistence farming or hunter-gathering. This idle time may be spent creating new things, or consuming those things previously created by others. Some people see efficiency gains as a way to do more work in the same amount of time, but it's equally possible to exploit those gains to do the same amount of work in less time, leaving more time to be idle, and hence bored, and hence looking for other things to do. Is the former choice always better than the latter lazy choice? I don't believe so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Retreating from the deep philosophical questions and getting back to the more mundane question of the blog title, I do own another domain that redirects to this one, and thus have occasionally tinkered with the idea of rebranding the site as &lt;a href="http://www.curiousefficiency.org/"&gt;Curious Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This would put a more traditionally "positive" spin on the concepts of idle investigation and elimination of unnecessary work mentioned in the blurb. However, I find the questions raised by the negative forms more intriguing though, and thus the current title remains. That said, if I ever get around to using my own domain for my primary email address, it will definitely be curiousefficiency rather than boredomandlaziness :)&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><guid>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201207the-title-of-this-blog.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2012 03:41:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Effective communication, brain hacking and diversity</title><link>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201107effective-communication-brain-hacking.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jessenoller"&gt;Jesse Noller&lt;/a&gt; recently posted an interesting quote on Twitter:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"One who feels hurt while listening to harsh language may lose his mindfulness and not hear what the other person is really saying."&lt;/blockquote&gt;When you think about it, human language is a truly awe inspiring tool. By the simple act of creating certain vibrations in the air, marks on a page or electromagnetic patterns in a storage system, we're able to project our thoughts and feelings across space and time, using them to shape the thoughts and feelings of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this ability to communicate is so thoroughly natural to most of us as humans that we typically take it for granted, it is actually an amazing world shaping capability &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY"&gt;deserving of our respect and attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And once we start giving it the attention it deserves, then we realise that we can judge the &lt;i&gt;effectiveness&lt;/i&gt; of our own communication by looking at the communication that is subsequently reflected back at us. How well do those reflections mirror the thoughts and feelings that our own words were intended to create? It's the linguistic equivalent of running our code and seeing if it does what we wanted it to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All communication is a form of brain hacking, even when the only target is ourselves. We write lists of goals - formulating for our own benefit concrete plans of action that we can then tackle one step at a time. We write polemics, trying to engender in others some dim sense of the joy or outrage we feel with respect to certain topics. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail. Sometimes we assume certain shared beliefs and understanding, so the point completely fails to come across to those without that common background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those closest to us, those with the most shared history, we have a rich tapestry of common knowledge to draw from. Movies we've all seen, books we've all read, events we all attended, discussions we were all part of - outsiders attempting to follow a transcript of our conversations would likely soon be utterly lost due to the shared subtext that isn't explicitly articulated (and the same is true for any group of close friends).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As groups get larger, the amount of truly common knowledge decreases, but there's still plenty of unwritten subtext that backs up whatever is explicitly articulated. In a certain sense, that unwritten subtext can be seen as the very &lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt; of culture - it's the things you don't have to say because they're assumed. My past &lt;a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/2011/04/musings-on-culture-of-python-dev.html"&gt;musings on the culture of python-dev&lt;/a&gt; are an example of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that brings us to the point of considering the opening quote, diversity and questions of common courtesy. When speaking to friends, I can share truly awful jokes without offence because of the shared background information as to what is and isn't acceptable (and what things should be taken seriously). As the group being addressed gets larger, then the valid assumptions I can make about shared views of the world become fewer and fewer, so I have to start explicitly articulating things I would otherwise assume, and simply not say some things because I know (or at least strongly suspect) that they won't come across correctly to the audience I'm attempting to reach. Sometimes even addressing similar groups of people in a different context can change the assumptions as to what is a reasonable way to phrase things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a member of my target audience gets hung up on my wording or my choice of examples to the point where they miss the underlying message, then to a large degree, the responsibility lies with &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; as the originator of the communication. Now, I'm not a saint and make no pretence of being one. The rich fields of metaphors in English include many relating to subjects that are truly quite horrific or otherwise offensive to various groups of people. Sometimes I'm going to use that kind of phrasing without thinking about it, especially when talking rather than writing (my own &lt;a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html"&gt;innate tact filter&lt;/a&gt; is definitely set up to filter incoming communication, so applying tact in the outwards direction is a conscious process rather than something I do automatically). If such a miscommunication happens and someone points it out, then the onus is on me to admit that yes, my choice of words was poor and obscured my meaning rather than illuminating it. That's life, I make mistakes, and hopefully we can move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not entirely a one way street, though. Just as we apply contextual analysis to our understanding of historical writings, so it can be useful to apply the same approach to things that are said by &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt; figures. Richard Dawkins recently made some ill-advised comments in relation to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org"&gt;Skepchick's&lt;/a&gt; advice to men to avoid certain actions that make them look creepy (that's all she said, "Don't do this, it's creepy" and she copped flack for it, as if she'd said people doing it should be sent to prison or castrated or something equally extreme). Does the fact that Dawkins clearly didn't get why he was &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/2011/07/dear-richard-dawkins/"&gt;in the wrong&lt;/a&gt; make him a horrible human being or devalue his extensive contributions to our understanding of evolutionary biology*? No, it doesn't, any more than Isaac Newton's obsession with alchemy devalued his contributions to physics and mathematics. It just makes him a product of the culture that raised him. Hopefully he'll eventually realise this and publicly apologise for failing to give the matter due consideration before weighing in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, what really surprised me is the number of people that indicate they're &lt;i&gt;shocked&lt;/i&gt; by his words, or questioning their support for his other activities just because he so vividly demonstrated his cluelessness on this particular topic. The world is a complicated place and the social dynamics of privilege, cultural blindspots and effectively encouraging diversity aren't one of the easiest pieces to comprehend. Hell, as a middle-class, 30-something, white, English-speaking, straight, cisgendered male living in Australia I'm quite certain that my own grasp of the topic is heavily coloured by the fact that on pretty much &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of the typical grounds for discrimination I'm in the favoured majority (being an atheist is arguably the only exception, but that's far less of a problem here in Australia than it is in the US. Our Prime Minister is an acknowledged atheist and even the Murdoch media machine didn't really try to make much of an issue out of that before the last election). I do my best to understand the topic of diversity based on the experiences of those that actually have to deal with it on a daily basis, but it's still a far cry from seeing things first hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, since I don't believe I can speak credibly to the topic of diversity directly, I instead prefer to encourage people to reflect on the value and nature of communication and community in general. Martin Fowler &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html"&gt;wrote an excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; about the challenge of creating communities that are welcoming to a diverse audience without rendering them bland and humourless (as the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Theories_of_humor#Benign_Violation_Theory"&gt;benign violations&lt;/a&gt; of expectations and assumptions that are at the heart of most humour often depend on the shared context that welcoming communities can't necessarily assume). This &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc"&gt;excellent video&lt;/a&gt; highlights the importance of focusing on &lt;i&gt;actions&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. "This thing you said was inappropriate and you should consider apologising for saying it") rather than &lt;i&gt;attributes&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. "You are a racist/misogynist/whatever"). If the latter is actually true, you're unlikely to change their mind and if it *isn't* true, you're likely to miss an opportunity to educate them as they get defensive and stop listening (refer back to that opening quote!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't pretend to have all (or even any of) the answers, I just believe the entire topic of effective communication and all it entails is one worthy of our collective consideration, since effective communication is almost always a necessary precursor to taking effective &lt;i&gt;action&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. on matters such as &lt;a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/2011/03/climate-change-skepticism-text-book.html"&gt;mitigating and coping with climate change&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many respects though, the entire topic is really quite simple. To quote Abe Lincoln in one of my all time favourite movies:&lt;blockquote&gt;Be excellent to each other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;----&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Seriously, read the popular science books on biology that Dawkins has written, especially "The Greatest Show on Earth". They're orders of magnitudes better than "The God Delusion", which is far too laden with angry and aggressive undertones to be an effective tool for communicating with anyone that doesn't already agree with the thesis of the book. In his biology books, his obvious love and passion for the subject matter comes to the fore and they're by far the better for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note for Planet Python:&lt;/b&gt; even though this post is about communication rather than code, I have included the python tag since a couple of different diversity related issues have come up recently on python-dev and psf-members. It is no coincidence that "communication" and "community" share a common(!) root in "communis".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><guid>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201107effective-communication-brain-hacking.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2011 07:10:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Climate change "skepticism": a text book case of the "Tragedy of the Commons"</title><link>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201103climate-change-skepticism-text-book.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with the government moving to implement a carbon tax, the issue of climate change and attempts to mitigate it are once again a big deal here in Australia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by a friend's comment comparing carbon taxes with fines for littering, along with a few of the  responses to that comment, I started pondering the similarities and differences between the current attempts to deal with carbon dioxide emissions, and the &lt;a href="http://www.edf.org/page.cfm?tagID=1085"&gt;effective cost internalisation schemes created&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990's that severely reduced industrial sulphur dioxide emissions, as well as various current laws that prohibit dumping of toxic waste in developed nations (and their &lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8012059_causes-dumping-third-world-countries.html"&gt;unintended side effects&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Fair warning before I wade in: I've simplified quite a few things, particularly on the acid rain front. This post is long enough as it is, without making it even longer with all the relevant caveats about other causes of acid rain and any other details I've glossed over as being irrelevant to the main point of the article. It's a general overview, not a peer reviewed scientific paper)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tale of two gases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key similarity between sulphur dioxide induced acid rain and carbon dioxide induced global warming is hopefully fairly obvious: they both represent a classic economic "externality", a cost borne by someone other than the person responsible for causing it. The industries and individuals emitting these pollutants don't suffer any immediate harmful consequence through the normal action of nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In situations like that, regulation in one form or another is the only effective tool we have to ensure that at least some portion of those external costs is reflected back on the responsible individuals. As noted in the link above, this approach proved extraordinarily effective in reducing acid rain in the US, drastically cutting sulphur emissions at a fraction of the originally predicted cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there are a few key differences that have contributed to the discussion over carbon dioxide taking a rather different path to that over sulphur dioxide:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's hard to deny the harmful effects of sulphur dioxide emissions when plants, fish and insects are dying due to the excessive levels of acidity in rain and ground water. By contrast, it is very hard to convey clearly why a small rise in average global temperatures is going to be such a bad thing, or even how human carbon dioxide emissions contribute to that happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acid rain from sulphur emissions is generally a &lt;i&gt;local&lt;/i&gt; problem with local causes (from a continental perspective, anyway). Stop emitting sulphur dioxide in the US and acid rain stops falling in the US. Significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Australia (or even the US) though, and we're likely still screwed if other countries don't follow suit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "sulphur" cycle (how long it takes for the sulphur emissions to be deposited back on the ground as acid rain) is significantly shorter than that of carbon, so efforts to reduce emissions will have an effect on water acidity levels in a reasonably short time frame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Comparisons with anti-waste dumping laws are similar: the effects of toxic waste dumping are generally both local, obvious and able to be cleaned up within years rather than decades, so it is easy to get support for laws prohibiting such practices, even if the end result of those laws is just to export the problem to a poorer country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manufacturing doubt and exploiting the "Grey Fallacy"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acid rain is an easy problem to sell: the acid damages plants and objects directly, so the harm can be easily conveyed through pictures and videos. The problem of climate change, though is far, far harder to illustrate simply, since it is a signal buried in some very noisy weather patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fundamental issue is the fact that people don't really experience climate, but instead experience weather. The day to day and seasonal variations in the weather massively exceed the scale of the underlying trends being discussed by climate scientists. The fact that predicting the weather in a few days time is harder than predicting long term climate trends is actually massively counterintuitive, even though almost all scientists and engineers are familiar with the fact that random fluctuations at a small scale may average out to something almost perfectly predictable at a large scale (compare the unpredictable nature of quantum physics with the straightforward determinism of classical Newtonian mechanics).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're also not really used to the idea of directly affecting the balance of the planet on a global scale. In absolute terms, the effects of the sun, the oceans and the plants on the carbon cycle all dwarf the human contribution. The idea that the non-human forcings were actually largely in balance with each other, and that the comparatively small human contribution is enough to tip that balance to the point of producing more carbon than can be absorbed by natural mechanisms is really quite a subtle one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientific background needed to truly understand and come to grips with the hows and the whys of the IPCC predictions reminds me of &lt;a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/272"&gt;this comic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the knowledge needed to even begin to understand the vagaries of string theory (make sure to click through on the comic itself to see the whole chain of images).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there wasn't anyone around with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo (at least for a while longer), this likely wouldn't be a problem. Scientists, politicians, economists and engineers could proceed with the development of mitigation strategies, while also attempting to educate the general populace as to the reasons behind any actions taken. Since such vested interests do exist, however, their opposition makes it significantly harder to convince the lay public that there is a real problem here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because climate science is such a complex topic, it is actually quite hard to explain to a non-scientist just &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; the scientific consensus is as strong as it is. If you oversimplify, you veer into territory where statements are so oversimplified that they border on being false. However, if you're coming from the other angle and want to persuade people that the science "isn't settled", then you're no longer constrained by the need to be accurate and can just go with whatever sounds more intuitively plausible and/or better caters to people's natural inclinations and prejudices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sites like &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/"&gt;Skeptical Science&lt;/a&gt; do their best to clearly explain why the oft-repeated "skeptic" arguments are basically BS (and do it well), but to someone only following the Cliff Notes mainstream media version of the debate, the temptation is still very, very strong to just assume the truth lies somewhere between the two positions being debated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Telling people to "do their own research" doesn't really help all that much in practice. Telling the BS from the valid science is itself a fine art that takes a great deal of skill and experience. Being a veteran of arguments with creationists (and even intelligent design advocates) is actually quite beneficial, since the global warming "skeptics" use many of the same rhetorical tricks as creationists do when attempting to deny the fact of evolution (incessant use of such deceptive tactics is actually one of the major hints that someone is trying to sell you a line rather than just stating the truth as they see it). The most common tactic used by both groups is to drag out a thoroughly rebutted argument for each new audience, in hopes that they aren't aware of the existence of a rebuttal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, just as most people can't answer "How could a bombardier beetle possibly evolve?" off the top of their heads - I've actually forgotten all of the plausible answers myself - neither can they answer questions like "If the climate is supposed to be warming, why is it colder now than it was during the Middle Ages?". While that one is actually fairly straightforward to answer (ice cores and other data shows that the medieval warming was likely localised to Europe due to various currents in the Atlantic, but this merely shifted heat around, so that other parts of the world were correspondingly colder), there are dozens of other oft-repeated thoroughly debunked arguments, and it's basically impossible for a mere interested observer to remember them all. As it turns out, I had actually misremembered the correct explanation for the Medieval warm period, so the point above isn't quite right and invites an attack on the grounds that I don't know what I'm what I'm talking about. To some extent that's actually true - my opinion on climate science issues is based on a meta-analysis of the trustworthiness of various information sources (including the full &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml"&gt;IPCC reports&lt;/a&gt;), since I'm not inclined to spend a few decades studying up and redoing all the science myself. Fortunately, Skeptical Science has the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period.htm"&gt;full story&lt;/a&gt; for this question and many others (the MWP was actually colder than the latter half of this century, despite higher solar activity and lower volcanic activity), so correcting my error is the task of a few moments. And if you're still wondering about the bombardier beetle thing, TalkOrigins has the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/bombardier.html"&gt;full story for that&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, at the decision making level here in Australia, this part of the debate seems to be coming to a close, with even Toby Abbott (the leader of the opposition) at least paying lip service to the fact that human-induced increases in average global temperatures are now a fact of life. However, the mainstream media is still happy to "teach the controversy" in the hopes of picking up a few more eyeballs (or ears) to sell to their advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the problem is so much bigger than us!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, even once you get agreement that human-induced global warming due to excessive carbon dioxide emissions is a genuine problem, you then run into the "But we can't do anything about it!" attitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many Australians (including some elected members of our Federal parliament) go "Oh, but the US/Europe/Brazil/Russia/India/China have a much bigger impact than we do. Doing anything will hurt our international competitiveness without really achieving anything, so we shouldn't bother."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the higher emission countries point fingers at each other. The US won't budge until China does. The BRIC countries are waiting for the US to make a move, and use US inaction as justification for similarly doing nothing in the meantime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An absolutely textbook "Tragedy of the Commons" reaction. And we know how that story ends, don't we? In the long run everybody loses, nobody wins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you fix it? Rules, regulations and social pressure. The "community of nations" isn't just words. The complex web of interdependencies that spans the world gives countries real power to exert influence on each other. Once some countries start to make a move towards serious carbon emission control strategies, then that becomes a bargaining chip to use in international negotiations. Will it work? Who knows. The only thing we know for sure is that the more carbon we pump into the atmosphere over the next few decades, the higher the impact from global warming will be (it's now guaranteed that there will be &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; impact - the carbon cycle is too long for us to prevent that at this late stage of the game).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally you would want to adopt an emissions trading scheme along the lines of that used to curb sulfur emissions, but the wholehearted embrace of dodgy pseudoscience by far too many members of our Federal Opposition party spiked that particular barrel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So a carbon tax it is (for now, anyway). The hysterical cries of "Oh my god, you've doomed the country!" ring loudly from those that will bear most of the direct costs of actually internalising the negative effects their carbon emissions have on the wider environment. Their motives are, to say the least, a little bit suspect. The political opportunism involved in our Federal Opposition leader backing them is disappointing, but unsurprising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the PM's words&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a nice summary of the current situation in a Fairfax &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/extreme-views-must-not-decide-carbon-tax-20110323-1c6ky.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; that went out over Gillard's byline:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The longer we leave it the harder action on climate change gets. This reform road is a hard one to walk. Just as doing nothing is not an option, we need to be careful to ensure that we do not make decisions that will cost our economy and jobs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There's a definite risk that the government's plans won't live up to their ambitions. However, the world's past experience with the sulfur dioxide doomsayers should arouse some deep skepticism and not directed towards those wanting to press forward with plans to curb carbon emissions.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><guid>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201103climate-change-skepticism-text-book.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2011 14:44:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Which matters more to you: being right or staying friends?</title><link>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201101which-matters-more-to-you-being-right.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browsing through the &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/"&gt;Religious Tolerance&lt;/a&gt; site, I felt inspired to turn my Ethos post into a Visitor Essay submission. I have no idea if they will ever post it (as it turns out, they did so quite promptly, &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/coghlan01.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but decided to put the whole thing up here (after the jump) regardless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The role of faith in my life has been a varied one. My parents are Roman Catholics (albeit ones with more than a few issues with the way the Church hierarchy run the show), and so I grew up doing the traditional Roman Catholic thing - convent primary school (although there were no teaching nuns by the time I came through) followed by a Christian Brothers high school (although again, one with mostly lay teachers). Church on Sunday was a weekly family ritual, and after drifting away into the typical agnosticism of the Australian teenager, I rediscovered my faith through the National Evangelisation Teams program. Enthused about my faith again, I started actually studying it - reading the Bible, looking at church teachings, that kind of thing. But something strange happened - the more I studied, the more hollow it all seemed. I *didn't* agree with everything the Bible said, or everything the Church taught, and neither did my parents. Clearly I was using something else as the basis for my moral decisions in which Church teachings I chose to agree with and which I chose to reject, but what was it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;A Star Wars fan website (of all things [1]) led me to encounter the phrase "secular humanism". Reading up on that, I found it agreed perfectly with the criteria I had been applying in picking and choosing amongst the teachings of the Catholic Church. I was happy to have found a term for my beliefs that focused on what I believed in, rather than simply highlighting one thing I had chosen to reject (i.e. "atheism"). One cognitive science degree and a whole lot of reading later (including the likes of Dawkins, Dennett, Hofstadter, Pinker and Sagan), and I was even happier with the idea of a world where we create our own meaning rather than having it passed down to us from on high. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The journey from childhood faith, through teenage agnosticism to adult faith and my eventual deliberate choice of a naturalistic world view was something that involved a lot of thought and introspection, that I was fortunate enough to have the time for. However, it left me with a problem. Many of my family are still devout (or not-so-devout) Catholics and my friends embrace a variety of religious traditions. How could I align what I had discovered for myself with their different points of view, without coming off (to myself or to others) as a condescending twit making allowances for the "less enlightened"? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The militant atheists (such as Dawkins) often come across as wanting to see the religious baby thrown out with the fundamentalist bathwater. Others (such as Dennett) are able to put forward a more nuanced view, that attempts to better understand the whole of religion, so that we can more effectively harness the positive aspects while reducing the negative effects. Having been a believer as an adult, and having suffered no significant negative experiences through my faith, I have a much easier time seeing the good side of religious belief than many atheists, so Dennett's line of rapprochement seemed far more appealing to me. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Eventually, I was able to distil my personal ethos down into a belief that the pillars of ethical and moral living consist of just 5 basic concepts: honesty, compassion, justice, freedom and hope. As I see it, we have to believe in something, otherwise nihilism wins and there is no point in getting out of bed in the morning. For myself, and humanists like me, I see those five things as products of evolution. I see them as glorious, beautiful things in their own right, the most profound creations of the human race. It is up to each of us to honour and steward each of the principles as best we can. Others choose to see those 5 principles as something that was gifted to us by a higher power, rather than something we created collectively ourselves over the course of time. I don't agree with such beliefs, but that is only because I see them as unnecessary. In practice, if the outcome is a personal faith that accepts and promotes the same 5 principles I believe in, then I don't really care all that much as to why somebody agrees they're important. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Where I start to have an issue is when groups and individuals either consciously or inadvertently start to disrespect those ideals. Whether the offenders are governments, organised religions, corporations, or specific individuals, malicious deceit, discounting of the feelings of others, inequitable treatment, unnecessary coercive restraints and excessive pessimism and fatalism are all concepts I have fundamental problems with. Of course, balancing all of those principles means that there are many situations encountered in the real world that have no right answers, only less bad wrong ones, which is why reasonable people may disagree on the correct courses of action. Simply "getting rid of religion" doesn't magically make the underlying issues go away. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;  The dangerous religions are the ones that create a priestly caste and then say to everyone else "It's complicated, it's a mystery, don't worry your pretty little head about it". By convincing people to shut down their capacity for critical thinking, they are trampling over a number of those principles I value (especially honesty and freedom). Religious traditions that instead encourage their believers to adopt an attitude of constant questioning are far more compatible with the humanist point of view, as it allows members of that faith to make their own judgments based on universal ethical principles in addition to the teachings of that specific tradition. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;This separation of beliefs from consequences (similar to the distinction made between beliefs and actions here at OCRT) and individual believers from religious organisations was the insight I needed to realise that it was possible to be religiously tolerant without feeling (or being) condescending about it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;[1] For the record, it was &lt;a href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/"&gt;Stardestroyer.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><guid>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201101which-matters-more-to-you-being-right.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2011 17:21:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Ethos</title><link>http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/posts/201012ethos.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: I expanded this post into a &lt;a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/2011/01/which-matters-more-to-you-being-right.html"&gt;more comprehensive essay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;Somewhat inevitably, Howard Tayler's review of Voyage of the Dawn Treader over on the Schlock Mercenary blog got into something of a religious debate in the comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My &lt;a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/dawn-treader#comment-110549921"&gt;contribution to the thread&lt;/a&gt; was an attempt at writing down the core concepts of a personal ethos I have been formulating over the last decade or so. I quite liked how it came out, so I figured I would capture it here as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For mine, I see the pillars of ethical and moral living as a belief in 5 basic concepts: honesty, compassion, justice, freedom and hope.
